Hi there!

Here are two example logs that you can use to play around with Disco. 


1) Purchasing process 
---------------------

The process is rather structured, but it has a number of problems that you can find easily with Disco. 

This is the same log that has been used for the sandbox project in Disco and in large parts of the user's guide. Before you import it, you can inspect its contents in Excel to see how a process log can look like. 


2) Callcenter process
---------------------

The callcenter log is a simplified and anonymized version of a real callcenter log. It is quite unstructured, and you can use Disco to simplify it, and to take different views on the process.  

Also this log has been used in the user's guide, and you can use it to follow the steps that are described there. 



We hope you enjoy Disco! Let us know if you have questions or remarks. We are happy to hear from you. 

Best wishes, 
Anne & Christian
