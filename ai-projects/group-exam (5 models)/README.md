# Group Exam: Machine Learning Models

This project contains the notebook `Group_exam.ipynb`, which demonstrates and compares five different machine learning models on the dataset `Hotel_Reviews.csv`. The models implemented include:

- LSTM
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Convolutional Neural Network
